												<h3>Adstream</h3>

											<p>This company marks my entry into a non traditional and highly technical organisation which is part of the digital economy. My time here has been characterised by moving between  high level strategic level issues to even basic operational level problem identification and solutions. Not surprisingly, as much as it prides itself in tech, the solutions to most of its problems centers on people and resource management.</p>

											<p>This UK based company marks my entry into a non traditional and highly technical organisation which is part of the digital economy. My time here has been characterised by moving between  high level strategic level issues to even basic operational level problem identification and solutions.

												<h3>FujiFilm Business Innovation</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Formerly known as FujiXerox, the company is a multinational group that combines western and Japanese management styles in its business operations. At its core is the spirit of Kaizen, continuous improvement and innovation. As the only MPS support group manager for the region, the full independant management control given has allowed me to learn and grow tremendously. It provided me great opportunities to push boundaries in management experiences and theories that contributed to my pragmatic skillsets today.</p>

												<h3>American Express</h3>
											</header>
											<p>First company that I joined as a fresh graduate way back in 2001 into the contact center industry. Amex remains a fond memory, a place that helped me built good leadership foundations and long lasting friendships. It is sincere in its pursuance of ethics and optimisation of performance. It remains successful to this day and continues to attract top talents effortlessly. An ivy league of companies. </p>
