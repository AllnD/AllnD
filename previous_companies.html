												<h3>Adstream</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This company represents my introduction to a non-traditional, highly technical organization within the digital economy. My tenure here has involved transitioning between high-level strategic planning and implementation, as well as addressing basic operational challenges and finding solutions. Interestingly, despite its strong focus on technology, many of the solutions to its challenges revolve around effective people and resource management.

												<h3>Fujifilm Business Innovation</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Formerly known as FujiXerox, the company is a multinational group that combines western and Japanese management styles in its business operations. At its core is the spirit of Kaizen, continuous improvement and innovation. As the only MPS support group manager for the region, the full independant management control given has allowed me to learn and grow tremendously. It provided me great opportunities to push boundaries in management experiences and theories that contributed to my pragmatic skillsets today.</p>

												<h3>American Express</h3>
											</header>
											<p>First company that I joined as a fresh graduate way back in 2001 into the contact center industry. Amex remains a fond memory, a place that helped me built good leadership foundations and long lasting friendships. It is sincere in its pursuance of ethics and optimisation of performance. I remembered it as a place with mostly intelligent people and has an extremely low ratio of corporate charlatans. It remains successful to this day and continues to attract top talents effortlessly. An ivy league of companies.</p>
